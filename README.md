# chrome-request-logger
This project was made by Evan Bubniak, David Quach, Chris Baudouin, Jr., and Nikhil Verma for hackRPI 2019.

It is a chrome extension that logs requests made by webpages during a site visit, and displays it to the user when they open the extension. The goal is to help educate the user about how their browsing habits cause data to be sent to third parties without their knowledge.
